Fusuma is now installed and running!

Please open Settings ---> Workspace Behaviour ---> Desktop Effects
and disable "Desktop Grid" and "Present Windows" to allow for these gestures
to work correctly.

You also need to navigate to Settings ---> Shortcuts ---> Kwin and
enable the shortcut for "Switch One Desktop to the Left" and "Switch One Desktop to the Right"
if they arent enabled already.

You also need to change the "Maximize Window" shortcut to "Meta+Alt+Up"
and "Minimize Window" shortcut to "Meta+Alt+Down" to get the tiling gestures to work.
(Fusuma doesn't play nicely with the default key combo for these functions)

Available gestures:

Swipe with three fingers left and right side of your screen
to tile a window to the left and right side of your screen respectively.

Swipe with three fingers up to maximize a window and then again to restore it.

Swiping down with three fingers acts as pull to refresh.

Swipe up and down with four fingers to show and hide the desktop grid.

Swipe with four fingers left and right to switch one desktop to the
right and left respectively.

Pinch with three fingers in to minimize a window and 3 fingers out to close it

Pinch with four fingers in and out to show and hide the desktop.

Try it out!

Fusuma is created by GutHub user iberianpig (https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma). I just decided to take its install instructions and compile it into a script for fun.

You can press control+c to exit this window.
